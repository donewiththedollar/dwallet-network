# Install dWallet

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Your system needs the following prerequisites to successfully install dWallet.

### Rust and Cargo {#rust-and-cargo}

dWallet requires **Rust** and **Cargo** (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems.
The recommended method to install Rust is with `rustup` using cURL.

Some commands in the installation instructions also require cURL.If you can't run the cURL command to install Rust,
see the instructions to install cURL for your operating system in the following section before proceeding.

To install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux, run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows 11,refer to the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website.
The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if needed.
Select the appropriate option for your environment and follow the installation wizard instructions.

For additional installation options, see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

dWallet uses the latest version of Cargo to manage dependencies and build the project.
For more details, see the [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) page.

Use the following command to update Rust with `rustup`:

```bash
rustup update stable
```
### Additional prerequisites by operating system

Select the appropriate tab to view the requirements for your system.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

    The prerequisites needed for the Linux operating system include:

    - [cURL](#curl)
    - [Git CLI](#git-cli)
    - [CMake](#cmake)
    - [GCC](#gcc)

    :::info

    The following instructions assume you are using a Linux distribution with the APT package manager.
    You may need to adjust the commands for other package managers.

    :::

    To install all the prerequisites at once, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install curl git-all cmake gcc libssl-dev libclang-dev libpq-dev build-essential
    ```

    #### All Linux prerequisites

    Reference the relevant sections that follow to install each prerequisite individually, or run the following to
    install them all at once:


    #### cURL \{#curl\}

    Install cURL with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install curl
    ```
    Verify that cURL installed correctly with the following command:

    ```bash
    curl --version
    ```

    #### Git CLI \{#git - cli\}

    Install Git and the [Git CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install git-all
    ```

    For more information, see [Install Git on Linux](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-linux) on
    the GitHub website.

    #### CMake \{#cmake\}

    Use the following command to install CMake.

    ```bash

    Index](https://index.ros.org/d/libclang-dev/).

    #### libpq-dev \{#libpq-dev\}

    Install `libpq-dev`:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
